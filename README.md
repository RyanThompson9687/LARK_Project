# LARK_Project
Project for Introduction to Unix course at Florida Polytechnic University in the Fall 2021 Semester.

Created a game in a CentOS Linux distribution using BASH programming, with the goal of teaching a new user to Linux about basic commands used to interact with a terminal. 

Game is playable only from a Linux command line. 
Playtime of roughly 15 minutes.

Game and Source Code is provided in a .tgz folder. This must be moved into a linux terminal and unzipped using the following command:
tar -xvzf TheKingdomOfCentosia-LarkGroup55.tgz TheKingdomOfCentosia-LarkGroup55

Once unzipped, cd into the game directory by running the following command:
cd TheKingdomOfCentosia-LarkGroup55

Run the command "ls" to see the game files, then run the command "cat readme.txt" to view the starting instructions for the game. 

The game is designed around a structure of nested folders and files, serving as paths to explore and items to interact with.
